# Deep-Learning
ANN using Keras and Tensor Flow Sci-kitlearn

The Neural Network models were created in jupyter notebook (Anaconda) using python , keras on top of Tensorflow.
Using alex-net structure I tried to implement a Convolutional Neural Network model that can detect the drivers state while driving.
There are 10 labels indicating the driver's state. The image sizes are static. The data set was provided by State Farms Insurance 
 through Kaggle.com. The model is not perfect, it is about 60% accurate.
