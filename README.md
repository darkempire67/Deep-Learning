# Deep-Learning
ANN using Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, Python and Keras on top of Tensorflow

The Neural Network models were created in jupyter notebook (Anaconda)using Sklearn, Numpy, Pandas, Python,  Keras on top of Tensorflow.

-> HW files are assingments from my Deep Learning class @ CalStateLA.
  Every model focuses on an important aspect of Deep Learning.
  Data sets are mostly from keras.datasets mnist.


->For Convolutional Neaural Network files:
  Using alex-net structure I tried to implement a Convolutional Neural Network model that can detect the   driver's state while driving.
  There are 10 labels indicating the driver's state. The image sizes are static. The data set was provided   by State Farms Insurance 
   through Kaggle.com. The model is not perfect, it is about 60% accurate.
